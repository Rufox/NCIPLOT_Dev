Version 3.2.7.6.2

! Integration algorithm modified. We made the comparation
! at the final curves
!
! This is NCIPLOT Ver. 3.2 Rev 7 Sub 6.1
! Simplified version without ELF,Laplacian, kinetic energy and energy densities
! and IGM.
! Computation of NCI volumns and charges with several references
! xyz, wfn available.
! C.Quan Multigrid implementation  
! Integration keyworkd suppresed.
! Line 1476 
! A cube is selected only if rho and redgrad values at its vertexes are within rho and redgrad ranges. 
! C.Quan original code rejected a cube only if rho and redgrad values at the vertexes are  outside 
! rho and redgrad ranges.
